Image denoising 
Images of low-quality are often corrupted by noise. The code tries to recover an image as close to the original image as possible using Gibbs Sampling and Variational Inference.
Input: Noisy/ corrupted image
Output: Uncorrupted image

Image Segmentation
Given an image, the idea is to decouple the foreground from the background using the expectation-maximization algorithm. 
Input: Image
Output: Mask image, foreground, background
